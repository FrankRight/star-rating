# Star Rating Component

If we plan on letting users drive the content on a website, we’ll need a way to know if that content is any good or not.

That makes the StarRating component one of the most important React components.

The StarRating component will allow users to rate content based on a specific number of stars.

Content that’s no good gets one star. Highly recommended content gets five stars.

Users can set the rating for specific content by clicking on a specific star.
